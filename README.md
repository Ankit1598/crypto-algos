This repository consists of some of the Cryptography Algorithms and it is a part of Hacktoberfest.

So if you are having any Cryptography Algorithm, all you need is to create a PR and I will try to merge it all.

This is an amazing opportunity for beginners to exhibit their Cryptography skills and take part in one of the largest Open-Source event!

## Algorithms

### [AES](https://github.com/Ankit1598/crypto-algos/tree/main/AES)
<br>

AES is an iterative rather than Feistel cipher. It is based on ‚Äòsubstitution‚Äìpermutation network‚Äô. It comprises of a series of linked operations, some of which involve replacing inputs by specific outputs (substitutions) and others involve shuffling bits around (permutations).


### [BlowFish](https://github.com/Ankit1598/crypto-algos/tree/main/BlowFish)
<br>

Blowfish is an encryption technique designed by Bruce Schneier in 1993 as an alternative to DES Encryption Technique. It is significantly faster than DES and provides a good encryption rate with no effective cryptanalysis technique found to date. It is one of the first, secure block cyphers not subject to any patents and hence freely available for anyone to use.

### [Columnar Transposition Cipher](https://github.com/Ankit1598/crypto-algos/tree/main/ColumnTranspositionCipher)
<br>

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/columnar-transposition-cipher1.png)

Given a plain-text message and a numeric key, cipher/de-cipher the given text using Columnar Transposition Cipher
The Columnar Transposition Cipher is a form of transposition cipher just like Rail Fence Cipher. Columnar Transposition involves writing the plaintext out in rows, and then reading the ciphertext off in columns one by one.


### [RSA](https://github.com/Ankit1598/crypto-algos/tree/main/RSA)
<br>

![](https://www.gatevidyalay.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Asymmetric-Key-Cryptography-Diagram.png)

RSA algorithm is a public key encryption technique and is considered as the most secure way of encryption. It was invented by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman in year 1978 and hence name RSA algorithm.
Algorithm

The RSA algorithm holds the following features ‚àí

    RSA algorithm is a popular exponentiation in a finite field over integers including prime numbers.

    The integers used by this method are sufficiently large making it difficult to solve.

    There are two sets of keys in this algorithm: private key and public key.

### [SHA-1](https://github.com/Ankit1598/crypto-algos/tree/main/SHA-1)

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/SHA-1.svg/300px-SHA-1.svg.png)

SHA-1 or Secure Hash Algorithm 1 is a cryptographic hash function which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value. This hash value is known as a message digest. This message digest is usually then rendered as a hexadecimal number which is 40 digits long. It is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard and was designed by the United States National Security Agency.
